Looking at your code, I can see the issue with the "Use My Location" feature. The problem is that the geolocation code is running fine, but there's a small bug in the UI update logic. Here's what's happening:

The Problem

In the getUserLocation() function, when geolocation succeeds or fails, you're trying to restore the button text but there's an issue with the DOM selection:

```javascript
// In the success and error callbacks, you have:
locateBtn.textContent = originalText;
```

But originalText contains HTML like <i class="fas fa-location-arrow"></i> Use My Location, not just the text. When you set innerHTML to the loading spinner, then try to set textContent back, you lose the icon.

The Fix

Replace these lines in your getUserLocation() function:

```javascript
// In the success callback, change:
locateBtn.textContent = originalText;
// To:
locateBtn.innerHTML = originalText;

// In the error callback, change:
locateBtn.textContent = originalText;
// To:
locateBtn.innerHTML = originalText;
```

Also Add This Improvement

Add this line at the beginning of the function to ensure the button text is properly captured:

```javascript
getUserLocation() {
    if (!navigator.geolocation) {
        this.showLocationStatus('Geolocation is not supported by your browser', 'error');
        return;
    }

    this.isLocating = true;
    const locateBtn = document.getElementById('use-my-location');
    const originalHTML = locateBtn.innerHTML;  // Store the HTML, not just text
    locateBtn.innerHTML = '<span class="loading"></span> Locating...';
    locateBtn.disabled = true;

    // ... rest of your code ...

    // Then in both success and error callbacks:
    locateBtn.innerHTML = originalHTML;  // Restore the HTML
    locateBtn.disabled = false;
}
```

Additional Debugging Steps

If this doesn't solve the issue, try these:

1. Check browser permissions: Make sure your browser has location access enabled for your site.
2. Add console logging to debug:

```javascript
getUserLocation() {
    console.log('Getting user location...');
    if (!navigator.geolocation) {
        console.error('Geolocation not supported');
        this.showLocationStatus('Geolocation is not supported by your browser', 'error');
        return;
    }

    // ... rest of your code ...

    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        (position) => {
            console.log('Location success:', position.coords);
            // ... rest of success code ...
        },
        (error) => {
            console.error('Location error:', error);
            // ... rest of error code ...
        }
    );
}
```

1. Test in different browsers - some browsers handle geolocation differently.
2. Check if it's a device issue by trying:
   · A different browser on the same device
   · The same browser on a different device

Quick Test

You can also test if geolocation works by opening your browser's console and running:

```javascript
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
    pos => console.log('Works!', pos.coords),
    err => console.log('Failed:', err)
);
```

The issue is definitely in your code, not your device, but it's a simple fix! The button gets stuck showing the loading spinner because the icon isn't being restored properly after the geolocation attempt completes.
